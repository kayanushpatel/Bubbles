Bubbles
=======

Creates random bubbles on a canvas using python's turtle module.


How it works
=======

* Asks user to input number between 0-500:
* User inputs integer and hits enter
* Turtle canvas comes onto screen and draws a 2 dimensional square boundry
* Then proceeds to draw number of circles that the user specified.
* The location and the color of the circles are randomized.
* The first time the program runs recursively and once user hits enter again it runs the iterative version after clearing the recursive drawing.
* Prompts user to hit enter to close the program.
